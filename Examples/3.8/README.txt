This example contains the input parameters sections 3.8 on single tension simulations for Takeuchi's experiments.

Euler angles were
(0, 0, 0) 		for <001> z-axis
(180, 45, 90)		for <101> z-axis
(0, 54.7356, 45)	for <111> z-axis
(-90, 35.2644, 45) 	for <112> z-axis


crss.f is modified to consider the total and forest densities together, so the modified file is included to the folder.
