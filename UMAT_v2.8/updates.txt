updates with respect to v2.1
- The variable "ipdomain" for IP domain size (area or volume) is added
************************************************
updates with respect to v2.2
- C3D8R element type is added (no GND calculation is possible)
************************************************
updates with respect to v2.3
- UMAT.f: The gradient calculaiton for elements with 1-int. points are eliminated from the solution
- creep.f: Dp is reset to zero
- globalvariables.f: nogradient flag is introduced for elements without enough number of integration points
- meshprop.f: C3D6 gradient calculation is avoided
- initializations.f: when using PROPS as the entry, material-ID is defined for which two different materials with the same phases can be present (noted by Guofeng)
- backstress.f: local Armstrong-Frederick backstress model is added
- useroutoutputs.f: backstress outputs are rearranged for per slip system outputs
************************************************
updates with respect to v2.5
- backstress.f: backstress model-2 calculation is updated to account for the sign of gammasum
- userinputs.f: the values of quadprec and phi are set to zero
- hardening.f: Hardening model-4 burgers vector is included as as multiplier to the substructure hardening
- hardening.f: Hardening model-4 "drhosub" term added over slip systems
- hardening.f: Hardening model-3 and 4 k1 term is divided by burgers vector
- cpsolver.f: the sign of gammasum is preserved due to the backstress calculations
- UMAT.f: if statement is added before GND calculations
- BUG-FIX - backstress.f: line-88 phaseid is corrected to materialid
- cpsolver.f: iterno<maxniter instead of iterno<=maxniter for both explicit and semi-implicit calculations
- cpsolver.f: added oiter==maxniter divergence criteria for semi-implicit case
- cpsolver.f: semi-implicit state update, the hardening function is called for the updated value of states (not for *_t)
- UMAT.f: gradient operator only calculated at the first step (KSTEP==1)
************************************************
updates with respect to v2.6
- cpsolver.f / innerloop.f / reverseslip.f: inverse method is added as a major update
- useroutputs.f: the variable used for the outputs of GND and backstress belong to the former time step
************************************************
updates with respect to v2.7
- hardening.f / crss.f / initialization.f / usermaterial.f : hardening model-4 is modified for direct definition of "k2"
- cpsolver.f / innerloop.f: inversion of Fp is modified
- cpsolver.f / innerloop.f: if statement incase of divergence, has been abbreviated
