updates with respect to v2.1
- The variable "ipdomain" for IP domain size (area or volume) is added
************************************************
updates with respect to v2.2
- C3D8R element type is added (no GND calculation is possible)
************************************************
updates with respect to v2.3
- UMAT.f: The gradient calculaiton for elements with 1-int. points are eliminated from the solution
- creep.f: Dp is reset to zero
- globalvariables.f: nogradient flag is introduced for elements without enough number of integration points
- meshprop.f: C3D6 gradient calculation is avoided
- initializations.f: when using PROPS as the entry, material-ID is defined for which two different materials with the same phases can be present (noted by Guofeng)
- backstress.f: local Armstrong-Frederick backstress model is added
- useroutoutputs.f: backstress outputs are rearranged for per slip system outputs
************************************************
updates with respect to v2.5
- hardening.f: Hardening model-4 burgers vector is included as as multiplier to the substructure hardening
- hardening.f: Hardening model-4 "drhosub" term added over slip systems
- hardening.f: Hardening model-3 and 4 k1 term is divided by burgers vector
- cpsolver.f: Tolerance is added on the solution for the forward gradient method
- userinputs.f: default parameters "quadprec" and "phi" are set to zero.
- initializations.f (line 1336): line direction (sense) is taken into account since in the summation it may cancel out
************************************************
updates with respect to v2.6
- inverse slip law has been added.
- forward gradient method is taken out.
