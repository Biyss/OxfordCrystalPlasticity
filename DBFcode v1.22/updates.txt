updates with respect to v1.18
userinputs.f-line 131: a parameter for the threshold for GNDs is added "gndthreshold"
straingradients.f-multiple locations: if statement for threshold check for models 1-2-4-5-6
cpsolver.f-line 689: total spin is corrected (the sign and magntide 1/2)
useroutputs.f-line 626/632: edge and screw indicators are added to the text
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
updates with respect to v1.19
crss.f-line 152/155: average burgers vector is corrected to per slip system
slip.f-sinh law: activation volume can be defined as a constant
slip.f-line 192: error check for zero activation volume
initializations.f-line 328: no need to define the screw systems in PROPS hence removed
globalvariables.f-line 144: corrected to integer type
usermaterials.f/initialization.f-multiple locations: introduced a constant X accounting for the portion of initial strength due obstacles
initializations.f-line 338: value of the parameter "gf" is corrected from integer to real
cpsolver.f-line 422: corrected, the material properties are taken out of if statement, related with temperature dependent simulations
straingradients.f-models1/2/3: added incremental tolerance check instead of overall values
slip.f-line197: the check for zero activation volume is commented out, needs to go initializations
multiple locations: the variables projGND, projSSD, SSD2GND are eliminated. Only "forestproj" variable is used for forest projections
globalvariables.f/initializations.f: "slip2screw" mapping is defined to map screw density from the slip systems (needed for gndmodels 4/5/6 and forest density calculations)
irradiation.f: added as irradiation model 2 global parameters, need to replaced by subroutines
initializations.f-line 331: added to read the value of X from 12th row of PROPS
DBFcode.for- UEXTERNALDB: initialize_once moved to (LOP=0) to avoid issues in parallel processing
initialize.f: a subroutine is added to read abaqus .inp file to find the number of elements and the element type
initialize.f-line226: readfrominputs corrected to be an integer read
fileIO.f: add the module fileIO that containts functions related with file reading (.INP file)
crsss.f: irradiation model-2 added
hardening.f: irradiation model-2 state update is added
fileIO.f: *.inp file is found and read to for the entries for total number of elements in the mesh (numel) and the element type (eltyp)
userinputs.f: input file name and location needs to be entered for linux solver
utilities.f-line1051: The expression of A must be substittude with U
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
updates with respect to v1.20
utilities.f: "svdgeninverse" subroutine is added for generalized inverse
straingradients.f: "calculateBmatPINV" subroutine is modified to use the generalized inverse
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
